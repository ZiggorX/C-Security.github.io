Our confidence in our government can become compromised if our security is breached and we do not discover threats before they are enacted. The national security and intelligence organisation claim that they are responsible for ‘providing advice to the national security council, coordinating and developing foreign and defence policy across government and coordinating ethical and legal issues across the intelligence community’ (Gov, n.d)</p><p>In this report I will discuss why I believe that government surveillance is a key aspect in the integrity and effectiveness of our national security by outlining the main issues and concerns, as well as current methodologies and laws used to uphold the safety of the general population. Finally, I will provide my analysis and what I think should be done in order to best suit the majority of the general population.</p><hr><h3 id=arguement>Arguement:</h3><p>Data protection is all about ensuring the safety and integrity of personal information against any type of unlawful alteration, loss or disclosure. The primary law that are in place in the UK are: Data Protection Act 2018 which is a supplementation of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPA). (What is data protection, n.d)</p><p>So, what exactly is GDPR/DPA? Well GDPR is considered to be the world’s strongest set of data protection rules. They enhance individuals’ abilities to access the personal data that organisations hold about them and limits what they can do with it. Within GDPR personal data is very important because individuals, organisations and companies are either ‘controllers’ or ‘processors’ of it and these are covered by law. (Matt Burgess, 24 mar 2020)</p><p>Government surveillance has become more understood and accepted since Edward Snowden leaked information about the US and UK governments ‘spying’ on us. He claimed that they were gathering all kinds of information without the targets knowing. In the UK his main concern was around GCHQ and their ‘hoovering up’ of all communications of everyone within the state.</p><p>When referring to this ‘blanket surveillance’ it means that they are gathering all information regardless of whether it is for a specific reason or not, this leads some people to believe that these methods are unlawful/unethical, and works against the data protection laws that are in place in the UK.</p><p>Why do agencies in such states intercept communications? Well for two main reasons, the first being that the information can be used as an investigative tool. If the agency has an email or domain known to be linked to say a terrorist organisation then they can ensure they intercept all of the communications going to and coming from them. This is known as targeted interception and does require an authorised warrant signed by the Secretary of state. Now in my opinion this is an effective method to perform surveillance of an individual/organisation as they have then got some form of responsible authority to give permission for the process.</p><p>The other reason that they would intercept communications is that it can be used to help to discover any national security threats through intelligence gathering. The only way that targeted interception can take place is if a threat has been discovered and proved to exist. It is here that most allegations begin because they must gather this information without knowing what it is, therefore it cannot be signed off by a higher power as it is an unknown.</p><p>Now if they do not know where the threat is or who it is coming from then how can they target them? In short, they can’t, unless they gather all information and siphon is down to what amounts to keywords, phrases, and specific activity. This method is the only reasonable one to use however does raise the questions of what happens with the data that is not used, if 99% of the data collected is irrelevant to national security then where does it go after processing. Is there any way of completely knowing whether or not the data is gone?</p><p>After much deliberation and thought I personally cannot think of any other way of discovering national security threats than pouring through all information, so this is not necessarily the problem, the real problem lies in whether or not the unused information is being held for any other purposes, which remains unclear in the complex and lengthy laws that cover this activity.
Many laws and acts surrounding data protection and the rights of authorities to search and seize our data are very complicated and long, this is necessary to cover the main concerns of those who worry about their data, however it also means that understanding them can become difficult, which allows for more secrecy within the administering bodies.
(Interception of communications, Intelligence and Security Committee of Parliament, p. 9)</p><p>One example of a surveillance project that has been underway by the UK government (specifically GCHQ) is the Tempora project. This program works by intercepting the data in most fiber-optic communication cables in and out of the country. This covers a large area of people’s communications, from Facebook, mail services like Yahoo and outlook.</p><p>The main reasons given for these are that they are ensuring national security is upheld, but as Amnesty have said in their article, they do not know if there is any reason beyond this. We have no clear idea of what data is gathered and who it is shared with. For this reason, they are taking action against the UK government because they believe that their data is being unlawfully accessed due to them being an ‘activist’ organization. Their main argument is that it is a violation of human rights for their privacy to be at risk because of their beliefs and lifestyles.
(Mass surveillance, 18 may 2020)</p><p>As I stated before, there is no other obvious method of identifying threats other than accumulating information about the people and organisations within the UK. However, it does compromise the privacy that most people do assume they are entitled to within the Human Rights act 1998, article 8, which stipulates that we should have the right to live our lives with privacy without interference from the state. (Your right to respect for private and family life, n.d)</p><hr><h3 id=closing-statement>Closing statement</h3><p>Mass surveillance is the most effective way of maintaining national security, not only can they cover the most ground by searching through all available information, but they can also maintain clear portfolios on the high-risk targets, allowing them to work effectively to remove/mitigate the threats that come from such groups/individuals.
National security can only be maintained effectively if the people who are responsible have the resources and information available to do so. They would not be able to monitor and identify threats without being able to see all of the picture. Without the data, there would be nothing to process, and no-one to stop these threats before they come.
The concerns of breaching privacy and circumventing laws that keep information protected are not unwarranted, however as with most things there is going need to be some compromise, would people rather have security in their safety or privacy (most likely both). Therefore, I believe that full transparency in the laws and a better promotion of the work that is being done would be a good start for this compromise. Not only would people know and understand what is happening, but they would understand why it is happening, making them more comfortable with what is going on.</p><p>Without any other clear-cut ways of identifying threats it is in my opinion that mass surveillance is a key component of national security, and that without it we would have no way of knowing and stopping threats that could compromise this. However, it is important to note that the laws and provisions in place should be made to be clear and precise, leaving little room for people to worry whether or not their data is still widely available to third-parties outside of our government bodies. As it stands there is little understanding of whether this is that case and this leads to many people becoming distrustful and concerned with what is happening behind the curtain. Without the support of people and organisations there may be an upscaled effort to hide and deceive the government processed which would result in the methods being used becoming ineffective and becoming detrimental to the national security of the country.</p><hr><h3 id=references>References</h3><p>GOV.uk.
