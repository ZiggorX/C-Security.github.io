<h2 id=team-leadership-theories>Team Leadership theories</h2>
<p>Team leadership theories have become the key element in understanding how an individual is able to effectively manage and administrate a group of individuals to become a team that can work concurrently and efficiently, with an emphasis on developing and nurturing growth within the environment they find themselves working in, irrespective of personal backgrounds, ability and overall work ethicises.</p>
<p>I will compare and contrast two well known theories and analyse their implementation when applied in practise. First of the two is behavioural theory,
“Behavioural theory is a management philosophy that evaluates leaders according to the actions they display in the workplace” (Indeed, 2020). Within this theory it is said that to be an effective leader you must act in a certain manner and behave in a way that is conducive to being an efficient administrator, self-organiser and understanding how actions can be used to produce the greatest results in a working team environment.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This type of leadership holds great significance in leaders who believe that the actions they undertake and implement into their project/group activities will be the primary decider in the type of leader they want to be. A ‘<em>great benefit of this leadership style is that anyone is capable of becoming a leader’ (WGU, 2020).</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of the main applications of the behavioural theory is the use of positive reinforcement to increase productivity within a group. Leaders/managers will use this method to reinforce positive actions when an employee is performing in the correct way as well as informing them when their actions are detrimental to the working methodologies and processes.</p>
<p>Second of the theories is <em>The great man theory</em> which is the idea that some people are born to lead and that only when there is a great need for them will they arise and bring out these traits they have inherited that make them so. This theory of leadership dictates that those born with the necessary attributes that set them apart from others are responsible for assuming positions of power and authority. (Management study guide, n.d).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As said by historian Thomas Carlyle <em>“the history of the world is but a biography of great men”</em>, this statement is one that creates an understanding of the importance of great men, and how they have shaped the understanding of our world and our nature as human beings, the history of how these people have acted, expecially in the face of adversity can teach us much about how we work as individuals and together as communities.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A recent and interesting example of the great man theory is that of the U.S President Donald Trump, a political no-body before the drastic and almost instant ascension to the highest office of America. This topic has been discussed and debated vigorously since he took the office in 2016 and the one recurring point that is bought up is how exceptional this was in the context of American history.</p>
<p>Most professional academics, whether they be historians, political scientists, sociologists tend to identify the phenomenon of the 2016 election as populism, due to the ever-increasing hostility to the elites of government, which left a large vacuum in the field of play for the election and this is where Donald Trump came in, bringing forth his personality traits that have kept him in such high-regard by his devoted followers, who have been looking for someone like him for a long time. (Bell, 2017)
These two theories are clearly highly contrasting, one suggesting the actions of the leader are what makes him great, the other claiming that a person is born to lead, with no need to deliberate on how they perform their duties. It makes for a very interesting study and will continue to cause much debate amongst professional academics for the foreseeable future.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id=monitoring-and-managing-performance-of-teams-and-individuals>Monitoring and managing performance of teams and individuals.</h2>
<p>Working with teams and as individuals can present their own challenges, as well as creating opportunities for abstract methods of improving performance and workflow. Being able to monitor the correct data and develop relevant methods to overcome the challenges presented can be a very effective way of constantly improving on targets, and work output/quality. Two concepts that work to achieve this are performance appraisals and performance management.</p>
<p>Performance appraisals tend to be more operational; they run as a top-down assessment and have rigid structures using a more quantitative approach. One method of doing this will incorporate SMART goals into the process that can be used to achieve targets by setting certain standards, assessing the performance and using that to give concise and constructive feedback that an employee could use to increase their motivation/performance.</p>
<p>Performance management is an overall strategic methodology that can be used to encourage further growth and development, they work on giving ongoing reviews that are run in a more flexible manner than performance appraisals. They are often used to ensure that an employee’s performance supports and contributes to the organisation’s strategic aims. (Thompson, M. 2020)</p>
<p>Ensuring that employees are working towards constantly improving and achieving more will also help to drive them toward contributing to the organisation’s strategic aims. Giving an employee a sense of purpose will help them to develop a vision, bringing a connection from the job to their core values, as Simon Sinek says ‘The why’ (Sinek, S. n.d). By creating a reason for why they are working, not just how and what, they will feel more inclined to do better.</p>
<p>John Adair, who is best known for his three-circle model of action leadership, gives some insight into the techniques that a leader can use to achieve high performing teams as well as individuals. By paying attention to the three needs of task, team and individual a leader will be able to help them achieve a common task.
Some examples of leadership functions that a leader can fulfil are:</p>
<pre tabindex=0><code class=language-term data-lang=term>-	Defining the task – Such as SMART targets
-	Planning – Searching for alternatives, using open-minded and creative processes.
-	Motivating – Keeping the team motivated using different principals of motivation
-	Briefing – Ensuring that the team is up to date and on the same level, this helps with motivation.
-	Controlling – Using good control systems to manage and delegate tasks appropriately.
-	Evaluating – A leader must be able to evaluate the team’s performance to improve and adapt them.
-	Organising – Being able to organise themselves and others.
-	Setting an example – Leading by example for the team and the individuals within it.
(BL. 2020)
</code></pre><p>If a leader is able to cultivate all of the aforementioned functions to a high level then they will be able to effectively motivate and improve upon their team’s performance, which will also directly impact the individual motivations. There are many cases where this can happen, this overlap in the task, team and individual, if a leader is able to correctly work with each, they will complement each other, such as if a team lacks cohesion, then the task may not be completed properly and the individual satisfaction is reduced. One method of promoting the group cohesion is by using the <em>stand together, fall divided</em> principle.</p>
<h2 id=methods-for-identifying-skills-and-knowledge-requirements-of-people-and-how-to-meet-the-identified-needs>Methods for identifying skills and knowledge requirements of people, and how to meet the identified needs.</h2>
<p>When working with teams it is important to understand the people that comprise them. As with all projects and tasks there are many skills and knowledge requirements that are essential to the operation and completion of them.</p>
<p>Due to this, a leader would need to be able to identify who is capable of what, where the skills gaps are present and how to adapt and overcome them using the resources available. Once these have been identified they must be met and maintained with thorough attention. Many approaches and methodologies are available to achieve these aims, I will discuss how they are effective in maintaining an efficient team by getting to the needs of the individuals.</p>
<p>Key performance indicators are a useful tool for determining how an employee is contributing to the business, they set out specific measures for how an employee is progressing in their career as well as strategic, financial and operational achievements. The measurements are used as a quantitative method of measuring long-term performance. (Investopedia, 2020).</p>
<p>By using these to monitor and manage the individuals you can build your teams to work in a way that fills and complements the individual strengths and weaknesses you have identified. Having your teams built this way will increase the productivity and efficiency as well as building effective groundwork for teamwork and co-operation.</p>
<p>Alternatively to the KPI’s, you can use direct employee assessments to identify skills gaps. By setting real working scenarios and reviewing where the employee is doing well and where they are struggling you can identify how to fill these skills gaps most effectively. (efrontlearning, 2017) Much like using KPI’s to build teams from the individual attributes, using the results from employee assessments to get the most productivity from your team can be very effective in building group cohesion and covering the group needed to complete a project at a high-level.</p>
<p>Another way of ensuring that you have appropriately covered the key skills and attributes that you require from employee’s is by using competency frameworks. These are very useful at supporting performance management and continuing an employee’s growth and achievements within an organisation.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Competency frameworks are broken down into components such as (Core values, core competencies and functional competencies). The core values are principals used to influence a person’s actions and choices, the core competencies are how all members for the organisation should behave, and then the functional competencies are defined by the responsibilities and duties of the specific jobs each employee is in charge of.</p>
<p>These three together give all employee’s a broader understanding of what is expected of them, therefore if they are lacking in a certain competency, they will be able to identify and improve upon this. It helps to bring cohesion and correct working practices into all areas of the working environment, meaning that the everyone can work together more efficiently and collaboratively. (IAEA, n.d).</p>
<p>An employer would be able to use the information that is given from these methods of identifying skills and knowledge requirements to fill the gaps and work with their employee’s to constantly improve and beat targets. By achieving these it will not only build on the individual’s relationship with the duties of their job, but it will also build on the relationship with the leaders who conduct these methods. They will feel more inclined to keep using the successful methods and will almost certainly continue to improve. Individual performance reviews are so integral to the effectiveness of these so they must be conducted professionally and with the appropriate information to complement the reviews.</p>
<h2 id=how-can-a-leader-create-a-high-performing-team>How can a leader create a high performing team?</h2>
<p>When working towards creating a high performing team, a leader must be able to understand the key components that all other high performing teams have displayed, examples being:</p>
<pre tabindex=0><code class=language-term data-lang=term>-	Shared goals, aims and vision
-	Open and effective communication
-	Respect for all
-	Commitment towards the group and goal
-	Setting feasible and achievable goals
-	Ensuring all group members are contributing
-	Having difficult but important conversations
-	Being dependable and punctual
</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>By utilising these components, a leader will be able to drive his team to exceed expectations and targets, as well as helping to continue development along the way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some of the examples can be explained and understood easily, such as ensuring the group contribution. A team will only be as good as the people it contains. A leader must be able to support and guide anyone who is not pulling their weight and achieving the same level as work as the others. If this is properly done it will keep everyone working on the same wavelength, increasing employee satisfaction and effectiveness.</p>
<p>Having shared goals, aims and vision may be more difficult to pinpoint and manage, however by using techniques discussed earlier as well as trying to steer everyone in using the competency frameworks you will be able to achieve close to having everyone viewing and understanding the project processes they will be going through, leading to a more uniformed workflow. (Nextgeneration, 2018)</p>
<p>The examples of open and effective communication, difficult conversations and respect for all employee’s are relatively simple to undertake, it requires a leader to have some level of charisma and an ability to lead an important conversation in the right direction. By using the correct rhetoric and understanding how the individual and group dynamics work will help a leader to achieve this.</p>
<p>Having diverse and cohesive teams can often present challenges, but in order to keep the team successful and working at a high level a leader must be able to work with the personalities and diverse natures of the people within groups. If they can create an understanding for these and really bridge the gaps that often appear when people work with others that they would not normally work with then they will be able to get the most out of their team.</p>
<p>Factors such as the size of the group, which management styles are used, what the work environment is like and how well the group formation is undertaken will dramatically effect group cohesion. If the employees are unhappy with how they are being treated or if they do not get on with other members then they most likely will not be as successful as if they did get on. (iresearchnet, n.d)</p>
<h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2>
<p>In conclusion I would say that a leader is required to pay full attention to the individuals as well as the characteristics of the relationship between themselves and the other members of the group. If they can understand what motivates their members and use it to improve upon the relationships then they will create a more successful group who work in unison towards a common goal. By utilising effective communication and establishing clear goals and targets they will be able to achieve them more often and with greater proficiency.</p>
<p>Understanding and working to improve the methods used to study and analyse performance will help to move towards better performance within a team, a leader should be able to not only understand them but must know how to adapt and overcome the plethora of problems that can occur during a team project.</p>
